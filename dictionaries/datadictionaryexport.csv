The CERA study will assess how you are feeling about your general health, anxiety levels, and mood at three points in time. Separate questionnaires will be issued before, during, and after the peak of the current COVID-19 outbreak.<strong><br /><br />What is the purpose of the CERA study?<br /></strong>This study will provide information regarding how staff working in Emergency care settings are feeling whilst working during the current COVID-19 outbreak. Full analysis of data will help identify how emergency staff can be better supported during future disease outbreaks.<strong><br /><br />Who has organised the CERA study?<br /></strong>The CERA study is led by the Trainee Emergency Research Network (TERN), in association with the Paediatric Emergency Research in the UK and Ireland (PERUKI) and Research and Audit Federation of Trainees (RAFT). <strong><br /></strong>The CERA study is supported by the UK Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM). <strong><br /><br />Has the CERA study received external approval?<br /></strong>Yes, the CERA study has received University Ethics Approval from the University of Bath (Ref: 4421). The CERA study has been approved by the Health Research Authority (HRA). <strong><br /><br />What will happen if I take part?<br /></strong>There will be three separate e-surveys to complete, including this one. Each survey is completed online, and will take between about 3 and 5 minutes. Surveys will be issued at different times.<strong><br /><br /></strong>You be required to submit your email address as part of this survey, which will allow us to invite you to participate in the other two surveys. You are not required to submit any additional personal identifiable information. We will remove your email address from data, prior to analysis. <strong><br /><br />Are there any potential risks?<br /></strong>Some of the issues explored will be sensitive, and we understand that this may be a challenging time for you. We have included some information about sources that you might wish to contact within this survey. <strong><br /><br />How will you protect my data and ensure confidentiality?<br /></strong>North Bristol NHS Trust is supporting this study and will be responsible for looking after your information and using it properly. The data collected will be stored for 5 years after the study has finished. <strong><br /><br /></strong>Your rights to access, change or move your information are limited, as we need to manage your information in specific ways in order for the research to be reliable and accurate. If you withdraw from the study, we will keep the information about you that we have already obtained. We will collect only personal identifiable information possible.<strong><br /><br /></strong>This study is also compliant with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). <strong><br /><br />Do I have to take part?<br /></strong>You are under no obligation to take part, and you may withdraw at any point without giving a reason. <strong><br /><br /></strong>What will happen to my data if I withdraw my involvement?<strong><br /></strong>If you choose to withdraw your involvement in the study, any results that you have submitted will be kept for analysis. However, you will not be required to input further into the study.We will need to use information from you for this research project. This information will include your email address. People will use this information to do the research or to check your records to make sure that the research is being done properly. Once we have finished the study, we will keep some of the data so we can check the results. We will write our reports in a way that no-one can work out that you took part in the study. <strong><br /><br />What are your choices about how your information is used? <br /></strong>You can stop being part of the study at any time, without giving a reason, but we will keep information about you that we already have. <strong><br /><br />Where can you find out more about how your information is used? <br /></strong>You can find out more about how we use your information <strong><br /></strong>• at www.hra.nhs.uk/information-about-patients/<strong><br /></strong>• our leaflet available from www.nbt.nhs.uk/PatientResearchdata<strong><br /></strong>• by asking one of the research team<strong><br /></strong>• by contacting Helen Williamson (Head of Information Governance) at helen.e.williamson@nbt.nhs.uk, or by ringing 0117 41 44767.<strong><br /><br /><br />Who can I contact if I have any questions?<br /></strong>Please contact Dr Tom Roberts (Chief Investigator) at tern@rcem.ac.uk if you have any questions. <strong><br /><br />What to do if you need support about wellbeing<br /></strong>The following organisations can help provide advice and support with regards to your wellbeing.<strong><br /><br /></strong>-Your occupational health department (contact details available via your employer)<strong><br /></strong>-Your general practitioner <strong><br /></strong>- https://anaesthetists.org/Home/Wellbeing-support<strong><br /></strong>-BMA Counselling Service (24 Hours).
